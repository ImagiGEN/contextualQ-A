# Assignment1
Application to aid research of investment analysts by searching through earnings call transcripts, to periodically upload text datasets, and providing features to filter by company and year.

## Project Flow 

In this assignment, our team will be working on building a contextual search application for Intelligence Co, a financial research company. The goal is to create a system that leverages vector similarity search, traditional filtering, and hybrid search features to aid financial analysts in searching through earnings call transcripts. We will be using a combination of tools including Redis for data storage, Airflow for data retrieval and processing, Streamlit for the front-end application, and FastAPI for building an API service. The metadata will be extracted from the data source and stored in a PostgresSQL database. Our solution will involve data exploration, implementing a search functionality, and hosting the application and database in Docker containers. Through this assignment, we aim to provide a user-friendly and efficient application for financial researchers to analyze earnings call transcripts effectively.
